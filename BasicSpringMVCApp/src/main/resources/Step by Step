		<!-- for compile only we need to have this entry -->
		<dependency>
			<groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
			<artifactId>servlet-api</artifactId>
			<version>${servletapi.version}</version>
			<scope>provided</scope>
		</dependency>

STEP 2 - Configuring view resolvers, annotation activation support & component scanning in "spring-servlet.xml"

STEP 3 - Configuring web.xml which has the dispatcher servlet entries, which will intercept all the requests.
		We also need to add "contextConfigLocation" entry which will contain the xml file name which are going to use to 
		configure spring related beans/view resolvers 
		
STEP 4 - How to execute?

Just run the application and it will be directed to below URL. Anyways in the web.xml it is mentioned that starting page
should be index.jsp
